## External Resources
For the SDF functions, both the shape equations and the combination of SDF functions, I used functions from Inigo Quilez's blog:
<https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm>
For normal calculation of SDFs, I referenced the following source:

I also referenced the CIS 460 lecture material on ray marching.
