## External Resources
- For the SDF functions, both the shape equations and the combination of SDF functions, I used functions from Inigo Quilez's blog:
<https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm>
- For normal calculation of SDFs, I referenced the following source:

- I also referenced the CIS 460 lecture material on ray marching.

## Inspiration
Over the summer, I used Houdini to generate procedural butterfly patterns which I used to shade butterflies. That project utilized existing software packages that have extensive features available. I was curious to see what I could create purely procedurally using SDFs and other tools.

## Implementation
### Geometry
#### Body
#### Wings
